# Bring Explainable-AI to the Next Level by Finding the “Few Vital Causes”

The classical plot used for explainability is the "force plot" from SHAP library:

<br/>
<br/>
However this plot contains too much information.
<br/>
I believe that it's better to focus on the "few vital" features that make the observation risky. 
<br/>
This could be done through a parallel plot:
